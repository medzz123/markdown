Idea to complete
- Drag and drop markdown files and preview 
- Write markdown side by side and show preview
- Multiple themes to choose from (different fonts, colours, dark theme, sizing)
- Convert makrdown to pdf

Maybe usefull for notes so...
- Create authentication
- Save individual md files somewhere (or string version somewhere)? Which one is better?
- Create file browsing kinda like system
